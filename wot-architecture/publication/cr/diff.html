<h2>
Abstract
</h2>
<p>
The
<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">
W3C
</abbr>
Web
of
Things
(WoT)
was
created
to
enable
interoperability
across
IoT
platforms
and
application
domains.
</p>
<p>
WoT
provides
mechanisms
to
formally
describe
IoT
interfaces
to
allow
IoT
devices
and
services
to
communicate
with
each
other,
independent
of
their
underlying
implementation,
and
across
multiple
networking
protocols.
In
addition
WoT
offers
a
standardized
way
to
define
and
program
IoT
behavior.
</p>
<p>
This
<em>
WoT
Architecture
</em>
specification
describes
the
abstract
architecture
for
the
<abbr title= "World Wide Web Consortium">
W3C
</abbr>
Web
of
Things.
It
is
derived
from
a
set
of
requirements
that
were
derived
from
use
cases
for
multiple
application
domains.
The
architecture
can
be
mapped
onto
a
variety
of
concrete
deployment
scenarios,
several
example
patterns
of
which
are
given.
</p>
<p>
This
specification
is
focused
on
the
scope
of
<abbr title= "World Wide Web Consortium">
W3C
</abbr>
WoT
standardization,
which
is
broken
down
into
so-called
building
blocks.
It
introduces
the
four
initial
WoT
building
blocks,
which
are
defined
and
described
in
detail
in
separate
specifications,
and
explains
their
interworking:
</p>
<p>
The
<em>
WoT
Thing
Description
</em>
is
the
central
building
block,
as
it
allows
to
describe
the
metadata
and
network-facing
interfaces
of
Things.
</p>
<p>
The
informational
<em>
WoT
Binding
Templates
</em>
provide
guidelines
on
how
to
define
so-called
Protocol
Bindings
for
the
description
of
these
network-facing
interfaces
and
provides
examples
for
a
number
of
existing
IoT
ecosystems
and
standards.
</p>
<p>
The
optional
<em>
WoT
Scripting
API
</em>
enables
the
implementation
of
the
application
logic
of
a
Thing
using
a
common
JavaScript
API
similar
to
the
Web
browser
APIs.
This
simplifies
IoT
application
development
and
enables
portability
across
vendors
and
devices.
</p>
<p>
The
<em>
WoT
Security
and
Privacy
Considerations
</em>
represent
a
cross-cutting
building
block,
which
should
be
applied
to
any
system
implementing
<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">
W3C
</abbr>
WoT.
It
focuses
on
the
secure
implementation
and
configuration
of
Things.
</p>
<p>
This
specification
also
covers
non-normative
architectural
aspects
and
conditions
for
the
deployment
of
WoT
systems.
These
guidelines
are
described
in
the
context
of
deployment
scenarios.
</p>
<p>
Overall,
the
goal
is
to
preserve
and
complement
existing
IoT
standards
and
solutions.
In
general,
<abbr title= "World Wide Web Consortium">
W3C
</abbr>
WoT
is
designed
to
describe
what
exists
rather
than
to
prescribe
what
to
implement.

<p>
The
goals
of
the
<em>
Web

Things
</em>
(WoT)
are
to
improve
the
interoperability
and
usability
of
the
Internet
of
Things
(IoT).
Through
a
collaboration
involving
many
stakeholders
over
the
past
years,
several
building
blocks
have
been
identified
that
address
these
challenges.
The

Common
Patterns
<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href= "#sec-common-usecase-patterns">
</a>
<p>
This
section
introduces
common
use
case
patterns
that
illustrate
how
devices/things
interact
with
controllers,
other
devices,
agents
and
servers.
In
this
section,
we
use
the
term
<em>
client
role
</em>
as
an
initiator
of
a
transport
protocol,
and
the
term
server
role
as
a
passive
component
of
a
transport
protocol.
This
does
not
imply
prescribing
a
specific
role
on
any
system
component.
A
device
can
be
in
a
<em>
client
</em>
and
<em>
server
</em>
role
simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
One
example
of
this
dual
role
is
a
sensor,
that
registers
itself
with
a
cloud
service
and
regularly
sends
sensor
readings
to
the
cloud.
In
the
response
messages
the
cloud
can
adjust
the
transmission
rate
of
the
sensor's
messages
or
select
specific
sensor
attributes,
that
are
to
be
transmitted
in
future
messages.
Since
the
sensor
registers
itself
with
the
cloud
and
initiates
connections,
it
is
in
the
'client'
role.
However,
since
it
also
reacts
to
requests,
that
are
transmitted
in
response
messages,
it
also
fulfills
a
'server'
role.
</p>
<p>
The
following
sections
illustrate
the
roles,
tasks,
and
use
case
patterns
with
increasing
complexity.
They
are
not
exhaustive
and
are
presented
to
motivate
for
the
WoT
architecture
and
building
blocks
that
are
defined
in
later
sections
of
this
specification.

Device
Controllers
<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href= "#device-controllers">
</a>
<p>
The
first
use
case
is
a
local
device
controlled
by
a
user-operated
remote
controller
as
depicted
in
<a href= "#smart-home-device" class="fig-ref" title="Device Control">
Figure
<bdi class="figno">
4
</bdi>
</a>.
A
remote
controller
can
access
an
electronic
appliance
through
the
local
home
network
directly.
In
this
case,
the
remote
controller
can
be
implemented
by
a
browser
or
native
application.
</p>
<p>
In
this
pattern,
at
least
one
device
like
the
electronic
appliance
has
a
server
role
that
can
accept
a
request
from
the
other
devices
and
responds
to
them,
and
sometimes
initiates
a
mechanical
action.
The
other
device
like
the
remote
controller
has
a
client
role
that
can
send
a
message
with
a
request,
like
to
read
a
sensor
value
or
to
turn
on
the
device.
Moreover,
to
emit
a
current
state
or
event
notification
of
a
device,
the
device
may
have
a
client
role
that
can
send
a
message
to
another
device,
which
has
server
roles.

Figure

shows
an
example
of
a
direct
Thing-to-Thing
interaction.
The
scenario
is
as
follows:
a
sensor
detects
a
change
of
the
room
condition,
for
example
the
temperature
exceeding
a
threshold,
and
issues
a
control
message
like
"turn
on"
to
the
electronic
appliance.
The
sensor
unit
can
issue
some
trigger
messages
to
other
devices.
</p>
<p>
In
this
case,
when
two
devices
that
have
server
roles
are
connected,
at
least
one
device
must
have
also
a
client
role
that
issues
a
message
to
the
other
to
actuate
or
notify.

Remote
Access
<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href= "#remote-access">
</a>
<p>
This
use
case
contains
a
mobile
remote
controller
(e.g.,
on
a
smartphone)
as
shown
in
<a href="#smart-home-multi" class="fig-ref" title="Multiple Network Interfaces">
Figure
<bdi class="figno">
6
</bdi>
</a>.
The
remote
controller
can
switch
between
different
network
connections
and
protocols,
e.g.,
between
a
cellular
network
and
a
home
network,
which
is
using
protocols
such
as
Wi-Fi
and
Bluetooth.
When
the
controller
is
in
the
home
network
it
is
a
trusted
device
and
no
additional
security
or
access
control
is
required.
When
it
is
outside
of
the
trusted
network,
additional
access
control
and
security
mechanisms
must
be
applied
to
ensure
a
trusted
relationship.
Note
that
in
this
scenario
the
network
connectivity
may
change
due
to
switching
between
different
network
access
points
or
cellular
base
stations.
</p>
<p>
In
this
pattern,
the
remote
controller
and
the
electronic
appliance
have
a
client
and
a
server
role
as
in
the

Figure
<bdi class="figno">

shows
a
use
case
using
a
Smart
Home
gateway.
The
smart
home
gateway
is
placed
between
a
home
network
and
the
Internet.
The
gateway
manages
electronic
appliances
inside
the
house
and
can
receive
commands
from
a
remote
controller
over
the
Internet,
e.g.,
from
a
smartphone
as
in
the
previous
use
case.
It
is
also
is
a
virtual
representation
of
a
device.
The
smart
home
gateway
typically
offers
proxy
and
firewall
functionality.
</p>
<p>
In
this
pattern,
the
home
gateway
has
both
a
client
and
a
server
role.
When
the
remote
controller
actuates
the
electronic
appliance,
it
can
connect
to
the
electronic
appliance
in
the
client
role
and
to
the
remote
controller
with
the
server
role.
When
the
electronic
appliance
emits
a
message
to
the
remote
controller,
the
gateway
act
as
server
roles
for
the
electric
appliance,
and
it
act
as
client
roles
for
the
remote
controller.

Summary
<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href= "#sec-use-case-summary">

<p>
The
previous
section
described
various
architecture
patterns.
In
these
patterns,
some
functional
entities
such
as
the
devices
including
the
legacy
devices,
controllers,
gateways
and
cloud
servers
are
located
at
physical
locations
such
as
inside
building,
outside
buildings,
and
data
centers.
<a href="#usecase-overview" class="fig-ref" title="Use Case Overview">
Figure
<bdi class="figno">
14
</bdi>
</a>
is
an
overview
that
shows
the
combinations
and
communication
paths
of
these
entities.
</p>
<p>
In
a
transport
protocol
layer,
each
entity
arbitrarily
selects
a
suitable
role
for
communications.
For
example,
a
device
may
act
as
a
server
when
the
device
provides
a
service
to
indefinite
number
of
applications.
On
the
other
hand,
if
a
device
has
limited
or
intermittent
network
connectivity,
they
may
act
as
a
client
and
actively
send
message
to
an
application
when
network
is
available.
Regardless
of
this,
in
application
layer,
an
application
sees
that
a
device
provides
abstract
interfaces
to
interact
and

Common
Principles
<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href= "#sec-requirements-principles">
</a>
<ul>
<li>
WoT
architecture
should
enable
mutual
interworking
of
different
eco-systems
using
web
technology.
</li>
<li>
WoT
architecture
should
be
based
on
the
web
architecture
using
RESTful
APIs.
</li>
<li>
WoT
architecture
should
allow
to
use
multiple
payload
formats
which
are
commonly
used
in
the
web.
</li>
<li>
WoT
architecture
must
enable
different
device
architectures
and
must
not
force
a
client
or
server
implementation
of
system
components.
</li>
<li>
Flexibility
<p>
There
are
a
wide
variety
of
physical
device
configurations
for
WoT
implementations.
The
WoT
abstract
architecture
should
be
able
to
be
mapped
to
and
cover
all
of
the
variations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Compatibility
<p>
There
are
already
many
existing
IoT
solutions
and
ongoing
IoT
standardization
activities
in
many
business
fields.
The
WoT
should
provide
a
bridge
between
these
existing
and
developing
IoT
solutions
and
Web
technology
based
on
WoT
concepts.
The
WoT
should
be
upwards
compatible
with
existing
IoT
solutions
and
current
standards.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Scalability
<p>
WoT
must
be
able
to
scale
for
IoT
solutions
that
incorporate
thousands
to
millions
of
devices.
These
devices
may
offer
the
same
capabilities
even
though
they
are
created
by
different
manufacturers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Interoperability
<p>
WoT
must
provide
interoperability
across
device
and
cloud
manufacturers.
It
must
be
possible
to
take
a
WoT
enabled
device
and
connect
it
with
a
cloud
service
from
different
manufacturers
out
of
the
box.

This

A
<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Thing
</a>
can
also
be
the
abstraction
of
a
virtual
entity.
A
virtual
entity
is
the
composition
of
one
or
more
Things
(e.g.,
a
room
consisting
of
several
sensors
and
actuators).
One
option
for
the
composition
is
to
provide
a
single,
consolidated
<a href= "#dfn-wot-thing-description" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
WoT
Thing
Description
</a>
that
contains
the
superset
of
capabilities
for
the
virtual
entity.
In
cases
where
the
composition
is
rather
complex,
its
<a href="#dfn-td" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
TD
</a>
may
<em>
link
</em>
to
hierarchical
sub-Things
within
the
composition.
The
main
<a href="#dfn-td" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
TD
</a>
acts
as
entry
point
and
only
contain
general
metadata
and
potentially
overarching
capabilities.
This
allows
grouping
of
certain
aspects
of
more
complex
Things.
</p>
<p>
Linking
does
not
only
apply
to
hierarchical
<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Things
</a>,
but
relations
between
Things
and
other
resources
in
general.
Link
relation
types
express
how
Things
relate,
for
instance,
a
switch
controlling
a
light
or
a
room
monitored
by
a
motion
sensor.
Other
resources
related
to
a
<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Thing
</a>
can
be
manuals,
catalogs
for
spare
parts,
CAD
files,
a
graphical
UI,
or
any
other
document
on
the
Web.
Overall,
Web
linking
among
Things
makes
the
Web
of
Things
navigable,
for
both
humans
and
machines.
This
can
be
further
facilitated
by
providing
Thing
directories
that
manage
a
catalog
of
available
<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">

usually
by

Affordances
<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href= "#sec-affordances">
</a>
<p>
A
central
aspect
in
<abbr title= "World Wide Web Consortium">
W3C
</abbr>
WoT
is
the
provision
of
machine-understandable
metadata
(i.e.,
<a href= "#dfn-wot-thing-description" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
WoT
Thing
Descriptions
</a>
).
Ideally,
such
metadata
is
self-descriptive,
so
that
<a href="#dfn-consumer" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Consumers
</a>
are
able
to
identify
<em>
what
</em>
capabilities
a
<a href="#dfn-thing" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Thing
</a>
provides
and
<em>
how
</em>
to
use
the
provided
capabilities.
A
key
to
this
self-descriptiveness
lies
in
the
concept
of
affordances.
</p>
<p>
The
term
affordance
originates
in
ecological
psychology,
but
was
adopted
in
the
field
of
Human-Computer
Interaction
[
<cite>
<a class= "bibref" href="#bib-hci" title= "The Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction, 2nd Ed">
HCI
</a>
</cite>
]
based
on
the
definition
by
Donald
Norman:
"'Affordance'
refers
to
the
perceived
and
actual
properties
of
the
thing,
primarily
those
fundamental
properties
that
determine
just
how
the
thing
could
possibly
be
used."
[
<cite>
<a class="bibref" href="#bib-norman" title="The Psychology of Everyday Things">
NORMAN
</a>
</cite>
]
</p>
<p>
An
example
for
this
is
a
door
with
a
handle.
The
door
handle
is
an
affordance,
which
suggests
that
the
door
can
be
opened.
For
humans,
a
door
handle
usually
also
suggests
<em>
how
</em>
the
door
can
be
opened;
an
American
knob
suggests
twisting,
a
European
lever
handle
suggests
pressing
down.
</p>
<p>
The
hypermedia
principle,
which
is
one
of
the
core
foundations
of
the
REST
architectural
style
[
<cite>
<a class="bibref" href= "#bib-rest" title= "REST: Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures">
REST
</a>
</cite>
],
demands
that
any
piece
of
information
available
on
the
Web
be
linked
to
other
pieces
of
information
so
that
the
consumer
of
the
information
gets
explicit
knowledge
about
how
to
navigate
the
Web
and
control
Web
applications.
Here,
the
simultaneous
presentation
of
information
and
control
(provided
in
the
form
of
hyperlinks)
is
a
mechanism
that
<em>
affords
</em>
Web
clients
the
means
to
drive
Web
applications.
In
this
context,
an
affordance
is
the
description
of
a
hyperlink
(e.g.,
via
a
link
relation
type
and
link
target
attributes)
suggesting
Web
clients
how
to
navigate
and
possibly
how
to
act
on
the
linked
resource.
Hence,
links
provide
navigation
affordances.
</p>
<p>
Drawn
from
this
hypermedia
principle,
the
Web
of
Things
defines
<a href="#dfn-interaction-affordance" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Interaction
Affordances
</a>
as
metadata
of
a

that
shows

the

thereby

Consumers
</a>
may
interact
with
the
<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">

</a>.
A
general
<a href="#dfn-interaction-affordance" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">

is
navigation,
which

activated
by

<p>
Originally,
a
Web
resource
usually
represented
a
document
on
the
World
Wide
Web
that
can
simply
be
fetched
by
a
Web
client.
With
the
introduction
of
Web
services,
resources
became
more
generic
interaction
entities
that
can
implement
any
kind
of
behavior.
This
very
high
level
of
abstraction
makes
it
hard
to
provide
a
loose
coupling
between
applications
and
resources
due
to
the
manifold
interaction
possibilities.
As
a
result,
at
the
time
of
writing
typical
API
descriptions
consist
of
a
static
mapping
from
an
application
intent
to
a
resource
address,
method,
request
payload
structure,
response
payload
structure,
and
expected
errors.
This
imposes
a
tight
coupling
between
Web
client
and
Web
service.

Hypermedia
Controls
<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href= "#sec-hypermedia-controls">
</a>
<p>
On
the
Web,
an
affordance
is
the
simultaneous
presentation
of
information
and
controls,
such
that
the
information
becomes
the
affordance
through
which
the
user
obtains
choices.
For
humans,
the
information
is
usually
text
or
images
describing
or
decorating
a
hyperlink.
The
control
is
a
Web
link,
which
includes
at
least
the
URI
of
the
target
resource,
which
can
be
dereferenced
by
the
Web
browser
(i.e.,
the
link
can
be
followed).
But
also
machines
can
follow
links
in
a
meaningful
way,
when
the
Web
link
is
further
described
by
a
relation
type
and
a
set
of
target
attributes.
A
hypermedia
control
is
the
machine-understandable
description
of
<em>
how
</em>
to
activate
an
affordance.
Hypermedia
controls
usually
originate
from
a
Web
server
and
are
discovered
in-band
while
a
Web
client
is
interacting
with
the
server.
This
way,
Web
servers
can
drive
clients
through
Web
applications
dynamically,
by
taking
their
current
state
and
other
factors
such
as
authorization
into
account.
This
is
opposed
to
out-of-band
interface
descriptions
that
need
to
be
preinstalled
or
hardcoded
into
clients
(e.g.,
RPC,
WS-*
Web
services,
HTTP
services
with
fixed
URI-method-response
definitions).

</p>
<p>
Usually,
an

The
IoT
uses
a
variety
of
protocols
for
accessing
devices,
since
no
single
protocol
is
appropriate
in
all
contexts.
Thus,
a
central
challenge
for
the
Web
of
Things
is
to
enable
interactions
with
the
plethora
of
different
<a href="#dfn-iot-platform" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
IoT
platforms
</a>
(e.g.,
OCF,
oneM2M,
OMA
LWM2M,
OPC
UA)
and
devices
that
do
not
follow
any
particular
standard,
but
provide
an
eligible
interface
over
a
suitable
network
protocol.
WoT
is
tackling
this
variety
through
<a href="#dfn-wot-protocol-binding" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">

</a>,
which
must
meet
a

<p>
A

or
more
precisely
their

A
lifecycle

(LCM)
system
may
encapsulate
those
lifecycle
operations
within
a
<a href= "#dfn-servient" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">

and
use
internal
interfaces
to
realize
the

The

vary

implementations.
The
<a href="#dfn-wot-scripting-api" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">

</p>
<p>
The

interface
with
the

implementation
of
the

The

the

An
implementation
of
a
<a href="#dfn-wot-runtime" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
WoT
Runtime
</a>
may
provide
local
hardware
or
system

to
behavior
implementations
through
the
<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Thing
</a>
abstraction,
as
if
they
were
accessible
over
a
communication
protocol.
In
this
case,
the
<a href="#dfn-wot-runtime" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
WoT
Runtime
</a>
should
enable
the
behavior
implementation
to
instantiate
<a href="#dfn-consumed-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Consumed
Things
</a>
that
internally
interface
with
the
system
instead
of
the
protocol
stack.
This
can
be
done
by
listing
such
system
Things,
which
are
only
available
in
the
local
<a href="#dfn-wot-runtime" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">

in
the

of
the

provided
by
the
application-facing
<a href="#dfn-wot-runtime" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">

API.
</p>
<p>
A
device
may
also
be
physically
external
to
a
<a href= "#dfn-servient" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">

</a>,
but
connected
via
a
proprietary

a

not

(see
<a href= "#sec-protocol-bindings" class="sec-ref">

</a>
).
In
this
case,
the
<a href= "#dfn-wot-runtime" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
WoT

</a>
may
access
legacy
devices
with
such
protocols
(e.g.,
ECHONET
Lite,
BACnet,
X10,
I2C,
SPI,
etc.)
through
proprietary
APIs,
but
may
again
choose
to
expose
them
to
the
behavior
implementation
via
a
<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Thing
</a>
abstraction.
A
<a href= "#dfn-servient" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Servient
</a>
can
then
act
as
gateway
to
the
legacy
devices.
This
should
only
be
done
if
the
legacy
device
cannot
be
described
directly
using
a
<a href="#dfn-wot-thing-description" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">

</p>
<p>
The
behavior
implementation
may
also
access
local
hardware
or
system
services
(e.g.,
storage)
through
a
proprietary
API
or
other
means.
This
is,
however,
out
of
scope
of
the

as
it

There

various
reasons

a

may
choose
to
implement
a

This
may
be
due
to
insufficient
memory
or
computing
resources,
so
the
developer
cannot
use
the

or
a
fully-featured

engine.
Alternatively,
to
support
their
use
case
(for

the

may
have
to
use
specific
functions

only
available

In

it

In

Intermediary
acting
as
a
Proxy
<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#sec-deployment-app-proxy-dev">
</a>
<p>
One
simple
application
of
an
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Intermediary
</a>
is
a
proxy
for
a
<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Thing
</a>.
When
the
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Intermediary
</a>
acts
as
a
proxy,
it
has
interfaces
with
two
separate
networks
or
protocols.
This
may
involve
the
implementation
of
additional
security
mechanisms
such
as
providing
TLS
endpoints.
Generally
proxies
do
not
modify
the
set
of
interactions,
so
the
TD
exposed
by
the
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary
</a>
will
have
the
same
interactions
as
the
consumed
TD,
however
the
connection
metadata
is
modified.
</p>
<p>
To
implement
this
proxy
pattern,
the
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Intermediary
</a>
obtains
a
TD
of
a
<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Thing
</a>
and
creates
a
<a href="#dfn-consumed-thing" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Consumed
Thing
</a>.
It
creates
a
proxy
object
of
the
<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Thing
</a>
as
a
software
implementation
that
has
the
same
<a href="#dfn-interaction-affordance" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Interaction
Affordances
</a>.
It
then
creates
a
TD
for
the
proxy
object
with
a
new
identifier
and
possibly
with
new
communications
metadata
(protocol
bindings)
and/or
new
public
security
configuration
metadata.
Finally,
an
<a href="#dfn-exposed-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Exposed

</a>
is
created
based
on
this
TD,
and
the
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary
</a>
notifies
other
<a href="#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">

<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">

may
be
known
as
<a href= "#dfn-digital-twin" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">

</a>.
A
<a href="#dfn-digital-twin" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Digital

</a>
may
or
may
not
modify
the
protocols
or
translate
between
networks,
but
they
provide
additional
services,
such
as
state
caching,
deferred
updates,
or
even
predictive
simulation
of
the
behavior
of
the
target
device.
For
example,
if
an
IoT
device
has
limited
power,
it
may
choose
to
wake
up
relatively
infrequently,
synchronize
with
a
<a href="#dfn-digital-twin" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
digital
twin
</a>,
and
then
immediately
go
to
sleep
again.
In
this
case,
typically
the
<a href="#dfn-digital-twin" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Digital
Twins
</a>
runs
on
a
less
power-constrained
device
(such
as
in
the
cloud
or
on
a
gateway)
and
is
able
to
respond
to
interactions
on
the
constrained
device's
behalf.
Requests
for
the
current
state
of
properties
may
also
be
satisfied
by
the
<a href="#dfn-digital-twin" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Digital
Twins
</a>
using
cached
state.
Requests
that
arrive
when
the
target
IoT
device
is
sleeping
may
be
queued
and
sent
to
it
when
it
wakes
up.
To
implement
this
pattern,
the
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary
</a>,
i.e.,
the
<a href="#dfn-digital-twin" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">

</a>
needs
to
know
when
the
device
is
awake.
The
device
implementation
as
a
<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Thing
</a>
may
need
to
include
a
notification
mechanism
for
that.
This
could
be
implemented
using
a
separate
<a href= "#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">

</a>
/
<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">

<a href= "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">

The

<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">

which
can
all
be
mapped
onto
a
common
protocol
(for
example,
HTTP,
with
all
interactions
mapped
to
a
single
URL
namespace
with
a
common
base
server
and
using
a

This
provides
the
remote
<a href= "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary
</a>
with
a
simple
way
to
access
all
the
<a href= "#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Things
</a>
behind
the
NAT
device,
assuming
the
local
<a href= "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary

has
used
a
converged
protocol
that
can
traverse
the
NAT
device
and
has
some
way
to
expose
this
service
to
the
Internet
(STUN,

etc).
In
addition,
the
local
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary

can
function
as
a
Thing
proxy,
so
even
when
the

use
a

(HTTP,

a

conventions,
the
<a href="#dfn-exposed-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">

can
converge
them
into
a
single
protocol
so
that
<a href="#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">

Figure
<bdi class="figno">
32
</bdi>
</a>,
there
are
two
clients
connected
to
the
remote
<a href= "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary
</a>,
which
has
aggregated
the
services
that
reside
behind
the
NAT
border
and
may
provide
additional
protocol
translation
or
security
services.
In
particular,
the
local
<a href= "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary
</a>
may
be
on
a
network
with
limited
capacity
and
making
that
service
directly
available
to
all
users
may
not
be
feasible.
In
this
case
access
to
the
local
<a href= "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary
</a>
is
<em>
only
</em>
provided
to
the
remote
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary
</a>.
The
remote
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Intermediary
</a>
then
implements
a
more
general
access
control
mechanism
and
may
also
perform
caching
or
throttling
to
protect
the
consumer
from
excess
traffic.
Those
consumers
also
will
use
a
single
protocol
suitable
for
the
open
Internet
(e.g.,
HTTPS)
to
communicate
with
the
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary
</a>,
which
makes
the
development
of
clients
much
simpler.
</p>
<p>
In
this
topology
there
is
NAT
and
firewall
functionality
between
the
consumers
and
things,
but
the
local
and
remote
<a href= "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediaries
</a>
work
together
to
tunnel
all
communications
through
the
firewall,
so
the
consumers
and
things
need
to
know
nothing
about
the
firewall.
The
paired
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Intermediaries
</a>
also
protect
the
home
devices
by
providing
access
control
and
traffic
management.

<p>
In
more
difficult
cases
the
NAT
and
firewall
traversal
may
not
work
exactly
as
shown.
In
particular,
an
ISP
may
not
support
publicly
accessible
addresses,
or
STUN/TURN
and/or
DyDNS
may
not
be
supported
or
available.
In
this
case
the
<a href= "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediaries
</a>
may
alternative
reverse
the
client/server
roles
between
them
to
set
up
an
initial
connection
(with
the
local
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary
</a>
first
connecting
to
the
remote
<a href= "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary
</a>
in
the
cloud),
then
the
pair
of
<a href= "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediaries
</a>
may
establish
a
tunnel
(using
for
example,
a
Secure
WebSocket,
which
uses
TLS
to
protect
the
connection).
The
tunnel
can
then
be
used
to
encode
all
communications
between
the
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediaries
</a>
using
a
custom
protocol.
In
this
case
the
initial
connection
can
still
be
made
over
HTTPS
using
standard
ports,
and
from
the
local
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Intermediary
</a>
to
the
remote
<a href="#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary
</a>
identically
to
a
normal
browser/web
server
interaction.
This
should
be
able
to
traverse
most
home
firewalls,
and
since
the
connection
is
outgoing,
network
address
translation
will
not
cause
any
problems.
However,
even
though
a
custom
tunneling
protocol
is
needed,
the
remote
<a href= "#dfn-intermediary" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Intermediary
</a>
can
still
translate
this
custom
protocol
back
into
standard
external
protocols.
The
connected
<a href= "#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Consumers
</a>
and
<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Things
</a>
do
not
need
to
know
about
it.
It
is
also
possible
to
extend
this
example
to
use
cases
where
both
<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">
Things
</a>
and
<a href="#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
Consumers
</a>
can
connect
on
either
side
of
the
NAT
boundary.
This
however
also
requires
a
bidirectional
tunnel
to
be
established
between
the
two

Once
local

services)
can
be
monitored
or
controlled
by
services
on
cloud,
a
variety
of
additional
services
can
be
built
on

For

However
when
the

a
part
of
a

the
clients
need
to
be

find
device
information
by,
for
example,
accessing
a
directory
of

For
simplicity
in
the

we

all

<a href="#dfn-thing" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">

their

Multiple

based
on
different
IoT
platforms
can
work
together
to
make
a
larger,
system-of-systems
eco-system.
Building

a

the
figure

shows
two

connected
to
each

make
a

Consider
the

(i.e.,
<a href= "#dfn-consumer" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">

use
a

in
another

There
is
more

mechanism
to
achieve
this

Security
and

Considerations
<a class="self-link" aria-label= "§" href="#sec-security-considerations">
</a>
<p>
<em>
This
section
is
non-normative.
</em>
</p>
<p>
Security
is
a
cross-cutting
issue
that
needs
to
be
taken
into
account
in
all
<a href="#sec-building-blocks">
WoT
building
blocks
</a>
and
WoT
implementations.
This
chapter
summarizes
some
general
issues
and
guidelines
to
help
preserve
the
security
and
privacy
of
WoT
implementations.
For
a
more
detailed
and
complete
analysis
of
security
and
privacy
issues,
see
the
<em>
WoT
Security
and
Privacy
Considerations
</em>
specification
[
<cite>
<a class= "bibref" href="#bib-wot-security" title= "Web of Things (WoT) Security and Privacy Considerations">
wot-security
</a>
</cite>
].
</p>
<p>
Overall,
the
goal
of
the
WoT
is
to
describe
the
existing
access
mechanisms
and
properties
of
IoT
devices
and
services,
including
security.
In
general,
<abbr title= "World Wide Web Consortium">
W3C
</abbr>
WoT
is
designed
to
describe
what
exists
rather
than
to
prescribe
what
to
implement.
</p>
<p>
However,
the
WoT
architecture
should
<em>
enable
</em>
the
use
of
best
practices
in
security
and
privacy.
The
WoT
security
architecture
must
support
the
goals
and
mechanisms
of
the
IoT
protocols
and
systems
it
connects
to.
These
systems
vary
in
their
security
requirements
and
risk
tolerance,
so
security
mechanisms
will
also
vary
based
on
these
factors.
</p>
<p>
Security
and
privacy
are
especially
important
in
the
IoT
domain
since
IoT
devices
need
to
operate
autonomously
and
in
many
cases
have
access
to
both
personal
data
and/or
can
be
in
control
of
safety-critical
systems.
Compared
to
personal
systems,
IoT
devices
are
subject
to
different
and
in
some
cases
higher
risks
than
IT
systems.
It
is
also
important
to
protect
IoT
systems
so
that
they
can
not
be
used
to
launch
attacks
on
other
computer
systems.
</p>
<p>
In
general,
security
and
privacy
cannot
be
guaranteed.
It
is
not
possible
for
the
WoT
to
turn
an
insecure
system
into
a
secure
one.
However,
the
WoT
architecture
needs
to
do
no
harm:
it
should
support
security
and
privacy
at
least
as
well
as
the
systems
it
connects
to.

Cross-Script

<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#sec-security-consideration-cross-script">

<p>
In
basic
WoT
setups,
all
scripts
running
inside
the
<a href= "#dfn-wot-runtime" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
WoT
Runtime
</a>
are
considered
trusted,
distributed
by
the
manufacturer,
and
therefore
there
is
no
strong
need
to
perform
strict
isolation
between
each
running
script
instance.
However,
depending
on
device
capabilities,
deployment
use
case
scenarios,
and
risk
level
it
might
be
desirable
to
do
so.
For
example,
if
one
script
handles
sensitive
privacy-related
PII
data
and
is
well-audited,
it
might
be
desirable
to
separate
it
from
the
rest
of
the
script
instances
to
minimize
the
risk
of
data
exposure
in
case
some
other
script
inside
the
same
system
gets
compromised
during
runtime.
Another
example
is
mutual
co-existence
of
different
tenants
on
a
single
WoT
device.
In
this
case
each
WoT
runtime
instance
will
be
hosting
a
different
tenant,
and
isolation
between
them
is
required.

The

should
avoid

Instead
a
<a href="#dfn-wot-runtime" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">

should
provide
a
hardware

layer

Such

Additionally,
in

it

The
<a href="#dfn-wot-runtime" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
WoT
Runtime
</a>
should
securely
store
any
provisioned
security
credentials,
guaranteeing
their
integrity
and
confidentiality.
In
case
there
are
more

one

a
single
WoT-enabled
device,
a
<a href="#dfn-wot-runtime" class= "internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
WoT
Runtime
</a>
implementation
should
guarantee
isolation
of
each
tenant's
provisioned
security
credentials.
Additionally,
in
order
to
minimize
a
risk
that
provisioned
security
credentials
get
compromised,
the
<a href= "#dfn-wot-runtime" class="internalDFN" data-link-type="dfn">
WoT
Runtime
</a>
implementation
should
not
expose
any
API
for
scripts
to
query
the
provisioned
security
credentials.
Such
credentials
(or
event
better,
abstract
operations
that
use
them
but
do
not
expose
them)
should
only
be
accessible
to
the
<a href= "#dfn-wot-protocol-binding" class="internalDFN" data-link-type= "dfn">

that
