# Substantive changes
- Thing ID is now no longer required to be unique, and is also now optional
- Terminology is now non-normative.
- The default value of "flow" in the OAuth2 security scheme was removed, and it was made mandatory
- A new assertion allows a Thing to reject incomplete writes for the writeallproperties operation

# Any changes in normative references?
- References to all other WoT documents, in particular the Web of Things (WoT) Architecture, have been made informative.
- As all terminology definitions are now informative, references only from that section are now informative, not normative.
- The following normative references were added: eventsource, RFC2046, RFC3987, RFC7616, RFC7617, websub, XMLSCHEMA11-2-20120405
- The following normative references were removed or converted into informative references: HTTP-in-RDF10, MQTT, IANA-MEDIA-TYPES, RFC3966, RFC6068, RFC7231, SHACL

# Any changes in requirements?
No.

# Wide Review of substantive changes
In addition to the wide reviews done for the previous CR transition, this version has addressed several issues raised by the Privacy IG during their review.

# Issues status
All issues are either closed or marked for resolution by PR transition (informative changes) or have been deferred to an update to be developed under a rechartered WG.

# Formal Objections
None.

# Any changes in implementation information?
- The Implementation Report has been updated and the version for this CR transition request can be found at
https://cdn.statically.io/gh/w3c/wot-thing-description/CR2-request/testing/report.html
- Additional implementations have been added by TUM (Technical University of Munich)
- Compared to the last CR, the PSK, API Key, and the OAuth2 flow "code" are now no longer at risk.   Other OAuth2 flows (implicit, password, and client) and the Cert, Public, and Pop Security Schemes are still at risk.  Default values associated with these items are also marked as at-risk.

# Deadline for further comments
We intend to request a PR transition on Dec 10, 2019.

# Any changes in patent disclosures?
No.
